#Structure
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ideal setup and best practices when working with AngularJS, RequireJS, jQuery, Stylus, Grunt, and Mocha. Feel free to submit ideas and improvements via pull requests. 

These tools are extremely powerful and complementary when used correctly together. More explanation to come.
